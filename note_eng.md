### Report Summary
This report analyzes the current program application based on four aspects: program functionality testing, program performance testing, mini-program design analysis, and content system. It summarizes issues with platform design logic and slow response of main functions, proposes optimization suggestions from a technical perspective for current problems, and presents ideas for promoting the integration of Nikon Cloud Creative solutions in mini-programs.

### **1. Functionality Testing**
- **Basic Functions**: Common platform functions operate normally. For specific module details, refer to the automated functionality testing report.
- **Issue Details**:
    - Password modification function lacks validation logic for old and new passwords
    - Sign-in page occasionally encounters server request errors (presumed insufficient high-concurrency handling)
    - Sign-in status inconsistent with actual status (presumed rendering synchronization issue)
    - Experience point statistics lack real-time display (presumed polling database interface issue)
    - Activity participation status display delay (browser rendering not synchronized)
    - Some URL routes lack explicit entry links (e.g., program startup splash page, user post list)

### **2. Performance Testing**
- **Response Delay**: External link redirects have appropriate response times; other pages and operations have long response times, causing user experience lag. See performance testing report for details.
- **Testing Description**:
    - Used Selenium and Lighthouse to test page navigation and interface loading website response conditions. *7.22 supplement: Subsequently added script testing for user image upload and posting operations, with single image posting time approximately 2.5-3 minutes (long waiting time). Note: this test is not reflected in the report document*
    - P.S. The online mini-program actual environment does not have conditions for load testing, stress testing, and security analysis.

### **3. Mini-Program Design**
- **UI Design Issues**:
    - Side-pull toolbar is actually meaningless and doesn't conform to UI design logic
    - User center interface function guidance is not prominent
    - **Post interaction icon "Comment" has inconsistent design language with other buttons, "Comment" icon easily misleads users**
    - Web version lacks enter-to-send confirmation logic
- **Functional Logic Defects**:
    - Single text matching search function logic is too simple; recommend adding search algorithms or category filtering functions
    - Lack of immediate feedback after activity registration (repeatedly clicking "Fill Questionnaire" button after clicking activity registration button violates common design logic; a completion registration popup asking "Do you want to fill the questionnaire?" would be better)
    - Published content cannot be modified, publishing process is time-consuming and prone to duplicate submissions (recommend backend validation of UID and content).
- **Other Issues**:
    - Voting function design lacks necessity for use

### **4. Content Aspects**
- **Chaotic Content Classification**:
    - Boundaries between Circle, Homepage, and Learning Discussion sections are blurred (recommend separating Q&A and discussion areas).
    - Activity questionnaires are heavily homogenized (e.g., repeatedly asking about Vlog shooting doesn't match multiple activity themes)
- **Content Quality and Mechanism Defects**:
    - Lack of recommendation algorithms, shallow interaction in image comment sections, post descriptions lack functionality (recommend official curation of high-quality content, i.e., adding administrator roles for management).
    - Tag system lacks purpose (doesn't support tag search, classification, or push notifications); "Photography Level" tag meaning unclear.
    - Lacks promotion and popularization support for Nikon tools (SnapBridge/NX Studio).

### **5. Summary and Recommendations**
- **Core Issues**:
    - Photo content is chaotic (lacks algorithmic filtering); Learning Discussion section is disorganized (recommend adding quality content exposure mechanisms).
    - Slow function response, weak user incentives.
- **Optimization Directions**:
    - **Functionality**: Fix status synchronization bugs, optimize publishing process and password validation.
    - **Design**: Unify UI design language, enhance operation guidance.
    - **Content**: Separate sections, introduce recommendation algorithms, clarify achievement rules.
- **Suggested Vision**: Option to select Nikon Cloud Creative solutions when uploading photos, add custom color options.
